# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a simple e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched from the Fake Store API. The platform features product display, search functionality, shopping cart management, and an order placement popup.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products using the search bar at the top of the page.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add, remove, and modify the quantity of products in the cart.
- **Price Details**: The cart includes a price summary showing total MRP, coupon discounts (if applicable), platform fees, and shipping charges.
- **Order Placement**: Users can place an order, which triggers a confirmation popup.
